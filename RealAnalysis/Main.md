This book, "Basic Analysis I: Introduction to Real Analysis, Volume I" by Jiří Lebl, is a one-semester course designed to introduce students to rigorous proofs in analysis and build a strong foundation for single-variable calculus. It aims to explain "why calculus is true" by delving into fundamental concepts like limits, derivatives, and integrals.

The book originated from lecture notes for Math 444 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and was expanded for Math 521 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (UW). It is suitable for both introductory courses and more advanced one-semester courses covering topics such as metric spaces, with a prerequisite of a basic proof course.

The structure of the initial chapters aligns with the UIUC Math 444 syllabus and shares similarities with Bartle and Sherbert's "Introduction to Real Analysis." A key difference is the use of Darboux sums for defining the Riemann integral, which the author believes is more appropriate for this level.

Here are detailed revision notes on Chapter 2, "Subgroups," drawing on the provided sources:

Chapter 2 delves into the concept of subgroups, which are fundamental building blocks of group theory. It covers their definitions, criteria for identification, specific types of subgroups, and how they relate to each other within a group structure.

### 2.1 Definition and Examples

*   **Definition of a Subgroup**: A non-empty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ (denoted $H \le G$) if $H$ itself forms a group under the binary operation of $G$.
*   **The Subgroup Criterion**: To prove that a non-empty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup, it is sufficient to show that:
    1.  For all $a, b \in H$, $ab \in H$ (closure under the group operation).
    2.  For all $a \in H$, $a^{-1} \in H$ (closure under inverses).
    *   A more concise **one-step subgroup criterion** can be used: $H$ is a subgroup if and only if it is non-empty and for all $x, y \in H$, $xy^{-1} \in H$.
*   **Examples of Subgroups**:
    *   For any group $G$, the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$ (containing only the identity element) and the group $G$ itself are always subgroups.
    *   The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ are a subgroup of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ under addition.
    *   The special linear group SL$_n(F)$ (matrices with determinant 1) is a subgroup of the general linear group GL$_n(F)$ (invertible matrices).
    *   For the dihedral group $D_{2n}$, the set of rotations $\{1, r, r^2, \ldots, r^{n-1}\}$ forms a subgroup.
    *   The even integers $2\mathbb{Z}$ form a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition.

### 2.2 Centralizers and Normalizers, Stabilizers and Kernels

This section introduces specific types of subgroups related to how elements or subsets interact within the group.

*   **Centralizer of an element ($C_G(a)$)**: For an element $a \in G$, its centralizer is the set of all elements in $G$ that commute with $a$:
    $C_G(a) = \{g \in G \mid gag^{-1} = a\}$.
    The centralizer $C_G(a)$ is always a **subgroup** of $G$.
*   **Centralizer of a subset ($C_G(A)$)**: For a non-empty subset $A \subseteq G$, its centralizer is the set of elements in $G$ that commute with every element in $A$:
    $C_G(A) = \{g \in G \mid gag^{-1} = a \text{ for all } a \in A\}$.
    This is also a **subgroup** of $G$.
*   **Normalizer of a subset ($N_G(A)$)**: For a non-empty subset $A \subseteq G$, its normalizer is the set of elements $g \in G$ such that $gAg^{-1} = A$:
    $N_G(A) = \{g \in G \mid gAg^{-1} = A\}$.
    The normalizer $N_G(A)$ is always a **subgroup** of $G$.
*   **Relationship between $C_G(A)$ and $N_G(A)$**: The centralizer $C_G(A)$ is always a subgroup of the normalizer $N_G(A)$. If $A$ is a subgroup, $C_G(A)$ is a normal subgroup of $N_G(A)$.
*   **The Center of a Group ($Z(G)$)**: The center of $G$ is the set of elements that commute with *every* element in $G$:
    $Z(G) = \{g \in G \mid gx = xg \text{ for all } x \in G\}$.
    Equivalently, $Z(G) = C_G(G)$. The center $Z(G)$ is always an **abelian normal subgroup** of $G$.
*   **Stabilizer and Kernel (revisited from Chapter 1.7)**:
    *   When a group $G$ acts on a set $S$, the **stabilizer of an element $s \in S$** (denoted $G_s$) is the set of elements in $G$ that fix $s$: $G_s = \{g \in G \mid g \cdot s = s\}$. The stabilizer $G_s$ is a **subgroup** of $G$.
    *   The **kernel of a group action** is the set of elements in $G$ that fix *every* element in $S$: $\{g \in G \mid g \cdot s = s \text{ for all } s \in S\}$. This kernel is a **normal subgroup** of $G$.

### 2.3 Cyclic Groups and Cyclic Subgroups

*   **Definition of a Cyclic Group/Subgroup**: A group $G$ is **cyclic** if there exists an element $x \in G$ such that every element of $G$ can be written as some power of $x$ (i.e., $G = \{x^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$). The element $x$ is called a **generator** of $G$.
    *   The subgroup generated by an element $x$ is denoted $\langle x \rangle$.
*   **Properties of Cyclic Groups**:
    *   Every cyclic group is **abelian**.
    *   The order of a cyclic group $\langle x \rangle$ is equal to the order of its generator $x$.
    *   If $\langle x \rangle$ is a finite cyclic group of order $n$, then $x^k = 1$ if and only if $n$ divides $k$.
    *   For a finite cyclic group $\langle x \rangle$ of order $n$, the element $x^k$ generates a subgroup of order $n/\mathrm{gcd}(n,k)$.
    *   Any two cyclic groups of the same order are **isomorphic**. For positive integers $n$, the infinite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to itself, and finite cyclic groups of order $n$ are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.
    *   Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

### 2.4 Subgroups Generated by Subsets of a Group

*   **Definition of Generated Subgroup**: For a non-empty subset $A$ of a group $G$, the **subgroup generated by $A$** (denoted $\langle A \rangle$) is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains $A$.
    *   Alternatively, $\langle A \rangle$ is the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ that contain $A$.
    *   If $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ is a finite set, the subgroup is denoted $\langle a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \rangle$.
*   **Elements of a Generated Subgroup**: The elements of $\langle A \rangle$ are all finite products of elements of $A$ and their inverses. If $G$ is abelian, this simplifies to products of elements of $A$ (and their inverses) where powers of the same element can be combined.
*   **Generators of Groups**: A group $G$ is said to be **generated by $A$** if $\langle A \rangle = G$.

### 2.5 The Lattice of Subgroups of a Group

*   **Lattice of Subgroups**: This refers to the graphical representation of the subgroups of a group, showing their containment relationships. Lines connecting subgroups indicate containment, with subgroups higher in the diagram containing those below them.
*   **Visualisation**: A lattice provides a "visualizing tool" for the structure of a group. This diagram depicts subgroups, elements, or parts of them, and describes specific group properties through the chapters.
*   **Examples of Lattices**: The sources provide examples of subgroup lattices for various groups:
    *   **Cyclic Groups**: Lattices for $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ such as $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$, and $\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$ are illustrated. For $p$ prime, the lattice of $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ is a single chain of subgroups.
    *   **Klein 4-group ($V_4$)**: A group of order 4, shown with its lattice. $V_4$ is abelian and is not isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$.
    *   **Symmetric Group ($S_3$)**: The lattice for $S_3$ is shown, illustrating its non-abelian structure through the arrangement of subgroups.
    *   **Dihedral Group ($D_8$)**: The lattice for the dihedral group of order 8 is provided.
    *   **Quaternion Group ($Q_8$)**: The lattice for $Q_8$ is also shown, highlighting its unique subgroup structure.
    *   **Dihedral Group ($D_{16}$)**: A more complex lattice for $D_{16}$ is presented, noting that it is not a planar graph.
*   **Significance**: The lattice helps in understanding the internal structure of a group and comparing different groups, particularly in the context of isomorphism. Non-isomorphic groups can have different lattices, while isomorphic groups have identical lattices.

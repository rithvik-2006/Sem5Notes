Chapter 1 introduces the fundamental concept of groups in abstract algebra.

### 1.1 Basic Axioms and Examples

*   A **binary operation** $\star$ on a set $G$ is a function $\star: G \times G \rightarrow G$, meaning that for any ordered pair of elements $(a,b)$ from $G$, the operation $\star$ assigns a unique element $a \star b$ within $G$.
*   A binary operation is **associative** if for all $a,b,c \in G$, $(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)$.
*   A binary operation is **commutative** if for all $a,b \in G$, $a \star b = b \star a$.

A **group** is an ordered pair $(G, \star)$ consisting of a set $G$ and a binary operation $\star$ on $G$ that satisfies the following axioms:
1.  **Associativity**: For all $a,b,c \in G$, $(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)$.
2.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ (called the identity) such that for all $a \in G$, $e \star a = a \star e = a$. The identity element is **unique**.
3.  **Inverse Element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \in G$ (called the inverse of $a$) such that $a \star a^{-1} = a^{-1} \star a = e$. Each element has a **unique inverse**.

Additional properties of groups:
*   A group $G$ is **abelian (or commutative)** if its binary operation is commutative, i.e., $a \star b = b \star a$ for all $a,b \in G$.
*   A group $G$ is a **finite group** if the set $G$ contains a finite number of elements. The number of elements in a finite group is called its **order**.
*   **Cancellation Laws**: In any group, if $ax = ay$, then $x=y$, and if $xa = ya$, then $x=y$.

**Examples from Integers**:
*   The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ forms a group under addition, as do the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ and real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
*   **Properties of the Integers**: The text reviews concepts like the **greatest common divisor (g.c.d.)** and the **Division Algorithm** for integers.
*   The **Euclidean Algorithm** is an important procedure for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. It can also be used to express the g.c.d. of $a$ and $b$ as a linear combination $ax+by$.
*   **Prime numbers** are positive integers greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and themselves.
*   The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** states that any integer $n > 1$ can be uniquely factored into a product of primes.
*   **Euler's $\varphi$-function**, denoted $\varphi(n)$, counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.
*   **Integers Modulo $n$ ($\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$)**: This set consists of residue classes modulo $n$. Addition and multiplication are defined on these classes.
    *   $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ forms a group under addition modulo $n$.
    *   $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$ denotes the multiplicative group of units modulo $n$, which consists of the residue classes $\bar{a}$ such that $a$ is relatively prime to $n$. The order of this group is $\varphi(n)$.

### 1.2 Dihedral Groups

*   The **dihedral group $D_{2n}$** is defined as the group of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon (a polygon with $n$ equal sides and $n$ equal angles).
*   The order of $D_{2n}$ is **$2n$**.
*   The elements of $D_{2n}$ include $n$ rotations (including the identity rotation) and $n$ reflections.
*   $D_{2n}$ can be generated by two elements, $r$ (a rotation) and $s$ (a reflection), satisfying the relations: **$r^n = 1$, $s^2 = 1$, and $srs = r^{-1}$**.
*   Any element in $D_{2n}$ can be written in the form $s^k r^i$, where $k \in \{0, 1\}$ and $i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$.
*   For $n \ge 3$, the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ is a **non-abelian group**.

### 1.3 Symmetric Groups

*   The **symmetric group $S_n$** is the group of all permutations of $n$ distinct objects.
*   A permutation is a bijection from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ to itself.
*   The order of $S_n$ is **$n!$** (n factorial).
*   Every permutation in $S_n$ can be uniquely written as a product of **disjoint cycles**.
*   A **transposition** is a 2-cycle, which swaps two elements and leaves the others fixed.
*   Any permutation can be expressed as a product of transpositions.
*   The **sign of a permutation** $\sigma$, denoted $\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)$, is $+1$ if $\sigma$ can be written as an even number of transpositions and $-1$ if $\sigma$ can be written as an odd number of transpositions.
*   The **alternating group $A_n$** is the subgroup of $S_n$ consisting of all even permutations. It is the kernel of the sign homomorphism $\mathrm{sgn}: S_n \to \{\pm 1\}$.
*   The order of $A_n$ is **$n!/2$** for $n \ge 2$.
*   $A_n$ is a **simple group** for $n \ge 5$.

### 1.4 Matrix Groups

*   A **field $F$** is a set with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) such that $(F,+)$ is an abelian group, $(F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group, and multiplication distributes over addition. Examples include $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$, and $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for a prime $p$.
*   The **general linear group GL$_n(F)$** is the group of all invertible $n \times n$ matrices with entries from a field $F$, under matrix multiplication.
*   The **special linear group SL$_n(F)$** is the subgroup of GL$_n(F)$ consisting of all $n \times n$ matrices with determinant 1.

### 1.5 The Quaternion Group

*   The **quaternion group $Q_8$** is a non-abelian group of order 8.
*   Its elements are $\{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$.
*   The defining relations for $Q_8$ are **$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$**.
*   $Q_8$ is one of the important examples of non-abelian groups of small order.

### 1.6 Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms

*   A **homomorphism** is a map $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ between two groups $(G, \star)$ and $(H, \circ)$ such that $\varphi(a \star b) = \varphi(a) \circ \varphi(b)$ for all $a,b \in G$. It preserves the group structure.
*   An **isomorphism** is a homomorphism that is also a bijection (both injective and surjective).
*   If an isomorphism exists between two groups $G$ and $H$, they are said to be **isomorphic**, denoted $G \cong H$. Isomorphic groups have identical algebraic structures.
*   The **kernel of a homomorphism** $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$, denoted $\mathrm{ker}(\varphi)$, is the set of elements in $G$ that map to the identity element of $H$ (i.e., $\mathrm{ker}(\varphi) = \{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) = e_H\}$). The kernel is always a **normal subgroup** of $G$.
*   The **image of a homomorphism** $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$, denoted $\mathrm{Im}(\varphi)$, is the set of all elements in $H$ that are images of elements from $G$ (i.e., $\mathrm{Im}(\varphi) = \{\varphi(g) \mid g \in G\}$). The image is always a **subgroup** of $H$.
*   The **First Isomorphism Theorem** states that if $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ is a homomorphism, then the quotient group $G/\mathrm{ker}(\varphi)$ is isomorphic to the image of $\varphi$, i.e., $G/\mathrm{ker}(\varphi) \cong \mathrm{Im}(\varphi)$.
*   **Lagrange's Theorem**: If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then the order of $H$ **divides** the order of $G$ (i.e., $|H| \mid |G|$). The number of distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is $|G|/|H|$, which is called the **index of $H$ in $G$**, denoted $[G:H]$.

### 1.7 Group Actions

*   A **group action** of a group $G$ on a set $A$ is a map $G \times A \rightarrow A$, denoted $(g,a) \mapsto g \cdot a$, satisfying the following two properties:
    1.  For all $g_1, g_2 \in G$ and $a \in A$, $g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot a) = (g_1 g_2) \cdot a$.
    2.  For all $a \in A$, $1 \cdot a = a$, where $1$ is the identity element of $G$.
*   The **kernel of the action** is the set of elements in $G$ that fix every element in $A$, i.e., $\{g \in G \mid g \cdot a = a \text{ for all } a \in A\}$. This is a normal subgroup of $G$.
*   The **stabilizer of an element $a \in A$**, denoted $G_a$, is the set of elements in $G$ that fix $a$, i.e., $G_a = \{g \in G \mid g \cdot a = a\}$. The stabilizer $G_a$ is a **subgroup** of $G$.
*   The **orbit of an element $a \in A$**, denoted $O_a$, is the set of all elements in $A$ that can be reached from $a$ by applying elements of $G$, i.e., $O_a = \{g \cdot a \mid g \in G\}$. The orbits form a partition of the set $A$.
*   The **Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem** states that for a finite group $G$ acting on a set $A$, for any element $a \in A$, the size of the orbit of $a$ multiplied by the size of the stabilizer of $a$ is equal to the order of the group: **$|G| = |O_a| \cdot |G_a|$**.
